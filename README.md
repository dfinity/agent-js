# agent-js

Use an Agent to interact with the Internet Computer from your JavaScript program.

This source code repository contains multiple npm packages, each under `./packages/`.

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the git repository.
2. Install the version of node specified in `.nvmrc`.
3. Run `corepack enable` to enable `pnpm`.

After that, you probably want to dive into a specific package in [./packages](./packages).

### Running Tests

Running tests is a good way to get a sense of what the features will do. We try to have full unit test coverage for all new features, although sometimes mocking network conditions can be difficult, and e2e tests may be preferable.

Before running tests, you need to compile the packages.

```shell
pnpm build
```

This command will compile the packages and generate the output under `lib` directory in each package.

#### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for all packages, run `pnpm test`. You can run tests for a specific package by running `pnpm test` in the package directory or by running `pnpm run -F <package-name> test` in the root directory.

#### E2E Tests

There is currently one set of e2e tests in this repository, located in the `e2e/node` directory.

> **Important Note:** the e2e tests do not run from the TypeScript source code of projects and must be compiled. You should run `pnpm build` to compile the projects after your changes before running the tests.

To run the e2e node tests, you can run

```shell
pnpm run -F @e2e/node setup
pnpm run -F @e2e/node e2e
```

#### Workspaces

We use `pnpm` to manage this repo and its packages. A few useful
commands to keep in mind;

- To run the unit tests locally, you can use `pnpm test`.
- To run e2e tests, you can use `pnpm e2e`. **WARNING:** You need to have a running
  replica locally.

### bin/\* scripts

The following scripts can be found in [./bin](./bin):

- update-management-idl - Update the management canister IDL in @dfinity/agent

Monorepo-related scripts run in this order, but are usually invoked by `pnpm i`:

- postinstall - Run with `pnpm postinstall` in this monorepo package.
  - It copies devtools dependencies from ./packages/agent-js-devtools/node_modules -> ./node_modules
- build - Build (`pnpm build`) each subpackage in ./packages/
- test - Run `pnpm test` in each subpackage
