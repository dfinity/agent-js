    <h1>Agent-JS Changelog</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Version 0.12.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changed the certificate verification interface and fixed its logic. The public constructor
          is now static and asynchronous. There is no separate verification method, the check is
          done automatically in the constructor and newly also checks that the delegation is
          authoritative for the given canister ID, as required by the Internet Computer interface
          specification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds a default callback to the IdleManager that will refresh the page after clearing the
          storage
        </li>
        <li>
          Adds a new utility method,
          <pre>canisterStatus</pre>
          , to @agent/js. Canister status now allows you to query paths from the canister
          certificate with a simple interface, using the API from the<a
            href="https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#state-tree-canister-information"
            >interface specification</a
          ><br />
          Comes with nicely configured options for
          <pre>time</pre>
          ,
          <pre>controllers</pre>
          ,
          <pre>subnet</pre>
          ,
          <pre>module_hash</pre>
          , and
          <pre>candid</pre>
          . Additionally, has a utility for reading custom MetaData set using
          <a href="https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm">ic-wasm</a>, as well as generic custom paths
          in the format of ArrayBuffers.
        </li>
        <li>updates to package.json files for metadata in npm</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for a corner case that could lead to incorrect decoding of record types.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          makeNonce now returns unique values. Previously only the first byte of the nonce was
          populated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduces IdleManager to the auth-client. You can now use it to detect when the user has
          been idle for a configurable amount of time, and then to register callbacks for the sake
          of logging the user out and prompting re-authentication. See the @dfinity/auth-client
          Readme for more details
        </li>
        <li>Reduces the maxTimeToLive default setting from 24 hours to 8</li>
        <li>
          Versioning tool now sets patch version to 0 for minor version updates, or patch and minor
          versions to 0 for major version updates
        </li>
        <li>Removes jest-expect-message, which was making test error messages less useful</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            HttpAgent now generates a nonce to ensure that calls are unique by default. If you want
            to opt out or provide your own nonce logic, you can now pass an option of
            <code>disableNonce: true</code>during the agent initialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are currently using
            <code>agent.addTransform(makeNonceTransform())</code>
            , please note that you should remove that logic, or add the <code>disableNonce</code>
            option to your agent when upgrading.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Candid now allows optional records to be omitted. See
          https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/issues/524
        </li>
        <li>
          In auth-client, login onSuccess callback and onError callback now supports async pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updates npm dependencies to resolve warnings for typedoc and node-fetch. No runtime
          dependencies were affected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Security enhancement - adds a rewrite for urls to subdomains of
          <pre>*.ic0.app/api</pre>
          to
          <pre>ic0.app/api</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Improves error messages for when HttpAgent cannot infer fetch implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fix for the auth-client identity option and added JSDOC comment for the timeToLive option
        </li>
        <li>
          Sets the default Internet Identity expiration to 1 day for the authClient, up from 15
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          No longer checks instanceof Principal in @dfinity/agent, which should allow non-identical
          versions of packages to interoperate, as long as they share the same API
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adds changelog for agent-js packages</li>
        <li>
          Buffer and Pipe refactor
          <ul>
            <li>
              In previous versions of dfinity packages, we relied on Buffer, a polyfilled version of
              the Node.js Buffer utility. In a significant refactor, we have removed all cases of
              this, along with Pipe and the nonstandard Blob packages, in favor of ArrayBuffer,
              Uint8Array, and DataView
            </li>
            <li>Utility methods such as <code>blobToUint8Array</code> have been removed.</li>
            <li>
              Interfaces that relied on Buffer and related packages have been updated to accept
              ArrayBuffer, and the type interfaces are updated to reflect this
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Secp256k1 Support
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adds two new exports to @dfinity/identity - Secp256k1KeyIdentity and
              Secp256k1PublicKey
            </li>
            <li>
              API mirrors the ed25519 components, and relies on the
              <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/secp256k1">secp256k1</a> npm package for
              signing and verification.
