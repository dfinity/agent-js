    <h1>Agent-JS Changelog</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Version x.x.x</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          feat: adds keyType option for AuthClient, allowing users to specify whether to use an
          ed25519 or ECDSAKey. This is important for custom storage providers that can't store
          CryptoKey objects
        </li>
        <li>chore: removes a circular dependency on index for canisterStatus</li>
        <li>chore: documents usage of fetch and fetchOptions for HttpAgent</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.15.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>reverts the X-IC-Request-ID header until we coordinate cors support with icx-proxy</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.15.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Corrects some dev dependencies incorrectly listed as dependencies in auth-client
          package.json
        </li>
        <li>
          introduces X-IC-Request-ID header to more easily identify retried requests. Also uses a
          standard Headers constructor to manage headers
        </li>
        <ul>
          Changes default stored key for auth-client to use ECDSAKey
          <li>Also updates the storage interface types to support CryptoKeyPair</li>
        </ul>
        <li>updates link to identity-secp256k1 in docs site</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.15.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>fixes a package configuration issue with @dfinity/identity-secp256k1</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.15.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Breaking change:</em> Moves Secp256k1KeyIdentity to its own package.
          <pre>@dfinity/identity-secp256k1</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Breaking change:</em> Deprecates
          <pre>@dfinity/authentication</pre>
          . If you relied on the
          <pre>isDelegationValid</pre>
          check, it has been moved to
          <pre>@dfinity/identity</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Deprecates
          <pre>@dfinity/identity-ledgerhq</pre>
          . Use
          <pre>@zondax/ledger-icp</pre>
          instead.
        </li>
        <li>chore: links assets docs in index</li>
        <li>chore: sets up new size-limit job for packages, in preparation for CI</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.14.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          feat: secp256k1 now supports a `fromSeedPhrase` method that will reproduce the same
          identity across agent-js, dfx, and quill
        </li>
        <li>chore: configures unpkg to use esmodules</li>
        <li>chore: removes unused lint shell script</li>
        <li>chore: adds js-sha256 dependency to principal</li>
        <li>
          bug: fixes idlemanager initializing - now either requires createOptions.identity or
          authClient.login to be called before starting idle timeout
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.14.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds retry logic to HttpAgent. By default, retries three times before throwing an error,
          to offer a more cohesive workflow
        </li>
        <li>Improves and truncates error messages in Candid</li>
        <li>fixes flaky tests for syncTime</li>
        <li>
          Adds a top-level <code>fetchCandid()</code> function which retrieves the Candid interface
          for a given canister id.
        </li>
        <li>chore: auth-client expose storage constant keys</li>
        <li>
          bug: auth-client resolves window.open issue in login function in safari due to async
          storage call
        </li>
        <li>
          New package: @dfinity/assets. This package provides an asset manager to manage assets on
          an assets canister.
        </li>
        <li>bug: auth-client storage wrapper returns after resolve to avoid idb to be recreated</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.13.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New package: @dfinity/bls-verify. This package provides a pure-js implementation of BLS
          verification using the miracl-core package. This can be used to polyfill BLS verification
          for agent-js, but it is notably very slow (~3s per verification). Optimization may be
          possible with a significant refactoring
        </li>
        <li>adds ability to polyfill bls verification in Certificate</li>
        <li>
          Auth Client moves key fallback generation to the create method instead of login and makes
          the _key non-nullable. This fixes a regression with async window.open behavior in Safari
        </li>
        <li>
          HttpAgent now offers a method to sync time with the replica, provided a specific canister.
          This can be used to set proper Expiry times when a device has fallen out of sync with the
          replica.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixes a candid bug where when decoding, optional fields could be skipped if the data on
          the wire contains additional fields.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.13.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>auth-client avoids localstorage global and can be used in a web worker or nodejs</li>
        <li>bug: auth-client logout now awaits clearing storage</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.13.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>fixes a bug with the localstorage migration strategy</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.13.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          AuthClient now uses IndexedDb by default. To use localStorage, import LocalStorage
          provider and pass it during AuthClient.create().
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Also offers a generic Indexed Db keyval store, IdbKeyVal</li>
        </ul>
        <li>AuthClient migrates gracefully from localstorage to IDB when upgrading</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.12.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Support for the SubtleCrypto interface in @dfinity/identity using the new ECDSAKeyIdentity
        </li>
        <li>CanisterStatus no longer suppresses rootKey errors</li>
        <li>Readme's point to https://agent-js.icp.xyz</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.12.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adds inline sourcemaps to packages</li>
        <li>
          Pulls lint out to a separate job now that Node 12 is failing with latest eslint
          dependencies
        </li>
        <li>Adds UTF-8 as an encoding option for CanisterStatus custom paths</li>
        <li>
          Adds a public method "createReadStateRequest" that creates the request for "readState".
        </li>
        <li>
          Add an extra parameter to "readState" to pass a created request. If this parameter is
          passed, the method does the request directly without creating a new one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the "createReadStateRequest" and the extra parameter when polling for the response to
          avoid signing requests during polling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adds derivationOrigin to auth-client login to support the ability to login using the
          identity derived from a different origin. See
          <a
            href="https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/pull/724/files#diff-44c106928503ccfb1b3f09f02513578552f66b68dea01c5ec4bd2de858bbba1a"

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.12.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changed the certificate verification interface and fixed its logic. The public constructor
          is now static and asynchronous. There is no separate verification method, the check is
          done automatically in the constructor and newly also checks that the delegation is
          authoritative for the given canister ID, as required by the Internet Computer interface
          specification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds a default callback to the IdleManager that will refresh the page after clearing the
          storage
        </li>
        <li>
          Adds a new utility method,
          <pre>canisterStatus</pre>
          , to @agent/js. Canister status now allows you to query paths from the canister
          certificate with a simple interface, using the API from the<a
            href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#state-tree-canister-information"
            >interface specification</a
          ><br />
          Comes with nicely configured options for
          <pre>time</pre>
          ,
          <pre>controllers</pre>
          ,
          <pre>subnet</pre>
          ,
          <pre>module_hash</pre>
          , and
          <pre>candid</pre>
          . Additionally, has a utility for reading custom MetaData set using
          <a href="https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm">ic-wasm</a>, as well as generic custom paths
          in the format of ArrayBuffers.
        </li>
        <li>updates to package.json files for metadata in npm</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for a corner case that could lead to incorrect decoding of record types.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.11.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          makeNonce now returns unique values. Previously only the first byte of the nonce was
          populated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduces IdleManager to the auth-client. You can now use it to detect when the user has
          been idle for a configurable amount of time, and then to register callbacks for the sake
          of logging the user out and prompting re-authentication. See the @dfinity/auth-client
          Readme for more details
        </li>
        <li>Reduces the maxTimeToLive default setting from 24 hours to 8</li>
        <li>
          Versioning tool now sets patch version to 0 for minor version updates, or patch and minor
          versions to 0 for major version updates
        </li>
        <li>Removes jest-expect-message, which was making test error messages less useful</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            HttpAgent now generates a nonce to ensure that calls are unique by default. If you want
            to opt out or provide your own nonce logic, you can now pass an option of
            <code>disableNonce: true</code>during the agent initialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are currently using
            <code>agent.addTransform(makeNonceTransform())</code>
            , please note that you should remove that logic, or add the <code>disableNonce</code>
            option to your agent when upgrading.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Candid now allows optional records to be omitted. See
          https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/issues/524
        </li>
        <li>
          In auth-client, login onSuccess callback and onError callback now supports async pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updates npm dependencies to resolve warnings for typedoc and node-fetch. No runtime
          dependencies were affected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Security enhancement - adds a rewrite for urls to subdomains of
          <pre>*.ic0.app/api</pre>
          to
          <pre>ic0.app/api</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Improves error messages for when HttpAgent cannot infer fetch implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fix for the auth-client identity option and added JSDOC comment for the timeToLive option
        </li>
        <li>
          Sets the default Internet Identity expiration to 1 day for the authClient, up from 15
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          No longer checks instanceof Principal in @dfinity/agent, which should allow non-identical
          versions of packages to interoperate, as long as they share the same API
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version 0.10.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adds changelog for agent-js packages</li>
        <li>
          Buffer and Pipe refactor
          <ul>
            <li>
              In previous versions of dfinity packages, we relied on Buffer, a polyfilled version of
              the Node.js Buffer utility. In a significant refactor, we have removed all cases of
              this, along with Pipe and the nonstandard Blob packages, in favor of ArrayBuffer,
              Uint8Array, and DataView
            </li>
            <li>Utility methods such as <code>blobToUint8Array</code> have been removed.</li>
            <li>
              Interfaces that relied on Buffer and related packages have been updated to accept
              ArrayBuffer, and the type interfaces are updated to reflect this
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Secp256k1 Support
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adds two new exports to @dfinity/identity - Secp256k1KeyIdentity and
              Secp256k1PublicKey
            </li>
            <li>
              API mirrors the ed25519 components, and relies on the
              <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/secp256k1">secp256k1</a> npm package for
              signing and verification.
