# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2025-08-22

Publishes the new `@icp-sdk/core` package.

This package unifies the following packages:
- `@dfinity/agent`
- `@dfinity/candid`
- `@dfinity/identity`

and re-exports them as `@icp-sdk/core/*` submodules.

The `@icp-sdk/core` package does not contain any other changes.

See the [upgrading guide](https://js.icp.build/core/latest/upgrading/v4/) for more information.

### Deprecated

- `@dfinity/use-auth-client`: this package has been deprecated. We recommend using one of the following alternatives:
  - [ic-use-internet-identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ic-use-internet-identity)
  - [@ic-reactor/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ic-reactor/react)

## [3.2.2] - 2025-08-21

- fix: add `bigint` to the `JsonValue` types in `@dfinity/candid`.

## [3.2.1] - 2025-08-12

- fix: export the `GenericIdlFuncArgs`, `GenericIdlFuncRets`, and `GenericIdlServiceFields` types from `@dfinity/candid`.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-08-07

- fix: do not subtract the replica permitted clock drift when calculating the ingress expiry.
- fix: pick the expiry rounding strategy based on the delta, without adding the clock drift to the delta.
- feat: adds a `clockDriftMs` optional parameter to `Expiry.fromDeltaInMilliseconds` to add to the current time, typically used to specify the clock drift between the IC network clock and the client's clock.
- fix: add declaration maps and typescript source code to published packages.
- feat: enables type inference for the arguments and return types of `FuncClass`.
- feat: enables type inference for the fields of `ServiceClass`.
- fix: perform the canister range checks unconditionally for delegations when constructing a `Certificate` instance.
- fix: account for clock drift when verifying the certificate freshness, and syncs time with the IC network if the certificate fails the freshness check and the agent's time is not already synced.
- feat: adds the `agent` optional field to the `CreateCertificateOptions` interface, which is used to sync time with the IC network if the certificate fails the freshness check, if provided.
- feat: adds the `getTimeDiffMsecs` method to the `HttpAgent` class, which returns the time difference in milliseconds between the IC network clock and the client's clock.
- feat: adds the `hasSyncedTime` method to the `HttpAgent` class, which returns `true` if the time has been synced at least once with the IC network, `false` otherwise.
- fix: use the effective canister id to delete the node keys from the local cache.
- docs: add DFINITY Starlight theme to the docs
- feat: adds the `disableCertificateTimeVerification` optional field to the `CanisterStatus.request` function argument, which allows you to control the `disableTimeVerification` option for the internal `Certificate.create` call.
- fix: avoid bigint overflow when decoding the time from the certificate.
- fix: enable certificate freshness checks for delegation certificates.
- feat: adds the `UncertifiedRejectUpdateErrorCode` error code.
- fix: changes error code to `UncertifiedRejectUpdateErrorCode` when throwing an error in v2 responses.
- fix: avoid syncing time indefinitely in case of an ingress expiry error.
- fix: throw an error with code `UncertifiedRejectUpdateErrorCode` if the reply from the update call was returned undefined and the method has no return type.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-07-24

- feat: export the `getCrc32` function from `@dfinity/principal`

## [3.0.2] - 2025-07-23

- fix: canonicalizes record and variant labels during subtype checking

## [3.0.1] - 2025-07-22

- fix: override `instanceof` in Candid IDL types to avoid issues when importing `IDL` from multiple locations.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-17

## [3.0.0-beta.4] - 2025-07-17

### Changed

- chore: replaces ts-node with `pnpm dlx tsx` for version management scripts
- chore: updates the version script to work with new pnpm workspaces
- feat: removes the watermark checks when checking query responses. Now the agent checks if the node signature is not older than the `ingressExpiryInMinutes` option (taking into account the clock drift).
- fix: always account for the clock drift when calculating the ingress expiry.
- fix: `AuthClient.create`'s options now have an additional `loginOptions` optional parameter, which is merged with the options passed to `login` when calling it.
- fix: handle BigInt values when instantiating the buffer in `lebEncode` and `slebEncode` from `@dfinity/candid`. As a result, `@dfinity/candid` now correctly encodes large bigints as `Nat` values.
- fix: make `.ts` extension required for all relative imports. This is required to avoid the "Module not found" error when importing the packages in Node.js (ESM).

### Added

- feat: Starlight documentation website, with custom plugin for typedoc

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-06-19

### Changed

- chore: update `@noble/*` dependencies
- fix: mark `@noble/hashes` as a dependency rather than a dev dependency

## [3.0.0-beta.0] - 2025-06-17

### Changed

- chore!: removes management canister from @dfinity/agent in favor of @dfinity/ic-management
- feat!: changes all @dfinity/candid interfaces to `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` instead of `ArrayBuffer` to make the API more consistent.
- feat!: replaces `fromHex`, `toHex`, `concat` utils with `bytesToHex`, `hexToBytes`, and `concatBytes` from `@noble/hashes/utils` respectively, to take advantage of existing dependencies.
- feat!: changes polling strategy for `read_state` requests to support presigned requests. By default, `read_state` requests will create a new signature with a new ingress expiry each time they are made. However, the new `preSignReadStateRequest` will make one signature and use it for all polling requests. This is useful for hardware wallets or other external signing solutions that make signing cumbersome.
  - pollForResponse now moves `strategy`, `request`, and `preSignReadStateRequest` to the `options: PollingOptions` object
  - new export: `PollingOptions` type
  - Actor also includes a `pollingOptions` object that can be passed to the `actor` function and will be passed to the `pollForResponse` method
- feat!: removes the unused `defaultAgent` global concept and the `getDefaultAgent` function. The `HttpAgent` constructor is now the only way to create an agent.
- feat!: removes the `ProxyAgent` class.
- feat!: removes the following errors in favor of the new `AgentError`:
  - `AgentHTTPResponseError`
  - `AgentCallError`
  - `AgentQueryError`
  - `AgentReadStateError`
  - `CertificateVerificationError`
  - `ActorCallError`
  - `QueryCallRejectedError`
  - `UpdateCallRejectedError`

  The new `AgentError` error uses the `code` and `kind` props to enable a better programmatic error handling.

- feat!: refactors `Expiry` class to use static factory methods and add JSON serialization/deserialization.
- feat!: makes `lookup_path` compliant with the [IC Interface Specification](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/blob/8015a4ab50232176723ffd95e32a02f1bf7fef30/docs/references/ic-interface-spec.md?plain=1#L3069). Renames the `lookup` method of the `Certificate` class into `lookup_path`, for consistency.
- feat!: removes the `lookup_label` method from the `Certificate` class.
- feat!: replaces `hash` with `sha256` from `@noble/hashes/sha2` to take advantage of existing dependencies
- chore!: drops support for Node.js v19 or lower, and Node.js v21

- feat: replaces `borc` and `simple-cbor` with `@dfinity/cbor`.
- chore: removes unused `bs58check` dependency from `@dfinity/identity-secp256k1`
- fix: AuthClient `isAuthenticated` now correctly returns false if the delegation chain is invalid; eg: expired session
- feat: introduces the `lookup_subtree` standalone function and `Certificate` class method.
- chore: formatting files and changelog
- test: removes backwards compatibility test for `Actor` with `v1` HttpAgent due to breaking interface changes.
- fix: Check subtyping relationship when decoding function or service references
  - This means we now follow the Candid spec more closely, and reduces the risk of calling services with the wrong argument types
- fix: retry requests that fail due to a malformed response body

## [2.4.1] - 2025-04-10

### Changed

- fix: fixes a bug in Ed25519KeyIdentity `toRaw` where the output was not an ArrayBuffer
- test: fixes e2e tests for compatibility with dfx 0.26.0 and `pocket-ic` by querying for the `default_effective_canister_id` before calling the management canister
- fix: fixes a bug in the Ed25519KeyIdentity verify implementation where the argument order was incorrect
- fix: fixes a bug in the `Principal` library where the management canister id util was incorrectly importing using `fromHex`
- feat: change auth-client's default identity provider url

## [2.4.0] - 2025-03-24

### Changed

- chore: changes trap e2e test to check for the response "trapping". Resolves a discrepancy with the replica response introduced in dfx 0.25.1
- fix: Bring Candid decoding of `opt` types up to Candid spec:
  In particular, when decoding at an `opt` type:
  - If the wire type is an `opt` type, decode its payload at the expected content type
    (as before).
  - Allow decoding `null` wire type as IDL value `null` (i.e. JS `[]`).
  - Allow decoding of value of `reserved` wire type, defaulting to IDL value `null` (i.e. JS `[]`).
  - Allow decoding of wider variant type on the wire at narrower expected variant type,
    provided the decoded value is valid at the expected variant type. Otherwise, default to `null` (i.e. JS `[]`).
  - Otherwise:
    - If the expected content type is `null` or `reserved` or (nested) `opt`, return IDL value `null` (i.e. JS `[]`).
    - The expected content type is neither `null`, `reserved` or nested `opt`:
      allow decoding of the non-optioned value `v` as `opt v` (JS `[v*]`) if compatible with
      the expected content type; if incompatible, return IDL value `null` (JS `[]`).

### Added

- feat: refactor nonce logic to prioritize options and ensure compatibility with ArrayBuffer and Uint8Array
- test: added e2e test for CanisterStatus requesting a subnet path, as a reference for getting the subnet id of a given canister id

## [2.3.0] - 2025-02-07

### Added

- shouldFetchRootKey option added to `HttpAgent` constructor
- ci: adds BOT_APPROVED_FILES config

### Changed

- feat: HttpAgent uses anonymous identity to make syncTime call, which can allow readState calls to work beyond 5 minutes
- chore: bumps .nvmrc and nodejs version in CI to 22
- HttpAgent now awaits fetching rootkey before making network calls if `shouldFetchRootKey` is set
- chore: npm audit fixes
- feat: enhanced details in agent call, query, and read_state errors
  - error now includes hex encoded response, requestId, sender_pubkey, and sender_sig in addition to message for improved debugging process

## [2.2.1] - 2025-02-07

### Changed

- fix: reverts read_state polling expiry changes due to mismatched signature introduced in 2.1.3. Polling will re-use the original request as before, up to the point where the request expires

## [2.2.0] - 2024-12-12

### Added

- fix: `target_canister` is used only for `install_chunked_code` of management canister, complying with internet computer specification

## [2.1.3] - 2024-10-23

### Added

- feat: allow for setting HttpAgent ingress expiry using `ingressExpiryInMinutes` option

- feat: improved assertion options for agent errors using `prototype`, `name`, and `instanceof`

### Changed

- test: automatically deploys trap canister if it doesn't exist yet during e2e
- fix: handle v3 traps correctly, pulling the reject_code and message from the certificate in the error response like v2.
  Example trap error message:

```txt
AgentError: Call failed:
  Canister: hbrpn-74aaa-aaaaa-qaaxq-cai
  Method: Throw (update)
  "Request ID": "ae107dfd7c9be168a8ebc122d904900a95e3f15312111d9e0c08f136573c5f13"
  "Error code": "IC0406"
  "Reject code": "4"
  "Reject message": "foo"
```

- feat: the `UpdateCallRejected` error now exposes `reject_code: ReplicaRejectCode`, `reject_message: string`, and `error_code?: string` properties directly on the error object.
- fix: recalculates body to use a fresh `Expiry` when polling for `read_state` requests. This prevents the request from exceeding the `maximum_ingress_expiry` when the replica is slow to respond.

## [2.1.2] - 2024-09-30

- fix: revert https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/923 allow option to set agent replica time

- feat: adds optional `rootKey` to `HttpAgentOptions` to allow for a custom root key to be used for verifying signatures from other networks
- chore: npm audit bumping micromatch
- feat: exports polling utilities from `@dfinity/agent` for use in other packages
  - `pollForResponse` now uses the default strategy by default
  - Updated the `bls-verify` jsdoc comment to accurately reflect that the default strategy now uses @noble/curves
- docs: clarifies meaning of `effectiveCanisterId` in `CallOptions`

### Changed

### Added

- test: adding test for backwards compatibility with actor for v1 agents
- feat!: deprecate `HttpAgent` constructor in favor of new `create` and `createSync` methods.
  - `create` is async and returns a promise. It will sync time with the replica and fetch the root key if the host is not `https://icp-api.io`
  - Replaces `source` option with a `from` and `fromSync` methods, similar to `Principal.from`

## [1.4.0] - 2024-06-17

```

Bitcoin

```ts
// For now, the verifyQuerySignatures option must be set to false

- **feat!: node signature verification**
  This feature includes additional changes in support of testing and releasing the feature:
  _ Mainnet e2e tests for queries and calls
  _ published counter canister
  _ New `HttpAgent` option - `verifyQuerySignatures`. Defaults to true, but allows you to opt out of verification. Useful for testing against older replica versions
  _ Introducing `ed25519` logic to agent for validating node signatures
  _ Standardizing around `@noble/curves` instead of tweetnacl in `@dfinity/identity`
  _ new export - hashOfMap from agent, matching the naming used in the interface specification
  _ new unit tests

  _ chore: increases size limit for `agent-js` to allow for `Ed25519` support for node key signature verification
  _ feat!: replaces `disableNonce` feature with `useQueryNonces`. Going forward, updates will use nonces, but queries and readstate calls will not. Queries and readsatate calls will use nonces if `useQueryNonces` is set to true
  _ feat: adds subnet metrics decoding to canisterStatus for `/subnet` path
  _ feat!: sets expiry to 1 minute less than the configured expiry, and then down to the nearest second. This matches existing behaviour, but adds the rounding

### Changed

- Improves and truncates error messages in Candid
- fixes flaky tests for syncTime
- Adds a top-level `fetchCandid()` function which retrieves the Candid interface for a given canister id.
- chore: `auth-client` expose storage constant keys
- bug: `auth-client` resolves window.open issue in login function in safari due to async storage call
- New package: @dfinity/assets. This package provides an asset manager to manage assets on an assets canister.
- bug: `auth-client` storage wrapper returns after resolve to avoid idb to be recreated

## [0.13.3]

### Changed

- New package: `@dfinity/bls-verify`. This package provides a pure-js implementation of BLS verification using the `miracl-core` package. This can be used to polyfill BLS verification for `agent-js`, but it is notably very slow (~3s per verification). Optimization may be possible with a significant refactoring
- adds ability to polyfill bls verification in Certificate
- Auth Client moves key fallback generation to the create method instead of login and makes the `\_key` non-nullable. This fixes a regression with async window.open behavior in Safari
- `HttpAgent` now offers a method to sync time with the replica, provided a specific canister. This can be used to set proper `Expiry` times when a device has fallen out of sync with the replica.
- Fixes a candid bug where when decoding, optional fields could be skipped if the data on the wire contains additional fields.

## [0.13.2]

### Changed

- `auth-client` avoids localstorage global and can be used in a web worker or nodejs
- bug: `auth-client` logout now awaits clearing storage

## [0.13.1]

### Changed

- fixes a bug with the localstorage migration strategy

## [0.13.0]

### Changed

- AuthClient now uses `IndexedDb` by default. To use localStorage, import LocalStorage provider and pass it during `AuthClient.create()`.

- Also offers a generic `IndexedDb` keyval store, `IdbKeyVal`

- `AuthClient` migrates gracefully from localstorage to IDB when upgrading

## [0.12.2]

### Changed

- Support for the `SubtleCrypto` interface in `@dfinity/identity` using the new `ECDSAKeyIdentity`
- `CanisterStatus` no longer suppresses rootKey errors
- Readme's point to https://agent-js.icp.xyz

## [0.12.1]

### Changed

- Adds inline sourcemaps to packages
- Pulls lint out to a separate job now that Node 12 is failing with latest eslint dependencies
- Adds `UTF-8` as an encoding option for `CanisterStatus` custom paths
- Adds a public method `createReadStateRequest` that creates the request for `readState`.
- Add an extra parameter to `readState` to pass a created request. If this parameter is passed, the method does the request directly without creating a new one.
- Use the `createReadStateRequest` and the extra parameter when polling for the response to avoid signing requests during polling.
- Adds `derivationOrigin` to `auth-client` login to support the ability to login using the identity derived from a different origin. See [proposed changes](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/pull/724/files#diff-44c106928503ccfb1b3f09f02513578552f66b68dea01c5ec4bd2de858bbba1a)

## [0.12.0]

### Changed

- Changed the certificate verification interface and fixed its logic. The public constructor is now static and asynchronous. There is no separate verification method, the check is done automatically in the constructor and newly also checks that the delegation is authoritative for the given canister ID, as required by the Internet Computer interface specification.

## [0.11.2]

### Changed

- Adds a default callback to the `IdleManager` that will refresh the page after clearing the storage
- Adds a new utility method, `canisterStatus`, to `agent-js`. Canister status now allows you to query paths from the canister certificate with a simple interface, using the API from the[interface specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#state-tree-canister-information)
  Comes with nicely configured options for

  `time`, `controllers`, `subnet`, `module_hash`, `candid`. Additionally, has a utility for reading custom MetaData set using [ic-wasm](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm), as well as generic custom paths in the format of ArrayBuffers.

- updates to package.json files for metadata in npm

## [0.11.1]

### Changed

- Fix for a corner case that could lead to incorrect decoding of record types.

## [0.11.0]

### Changed

- makeNonce now returns unique values. Previously only the first byte of the nonce was populated.
- Introduces `IdleManager` to the `auth-client`. You can now use it to detect when the user has been idle for a configurable amount of time, and then to register callbacks for the sake of logging the user out and prompting re-authentication. See the `@dfinity/auth-client` Readme for more details
- Reduces the `maxTimeToLive` default setting from 24 hours to 8
- Versioning tool now sets patch version to 0 for minor version updates, or patch and minor versions to 0 for major version updates
- Removes jest-expect-message, which was making test error messages less useful
- `HttpAgent` now generates a nonce to ensure that calls are unique by default. If you want to opt out or provide your own nonce logic, you can now pass an option of `disableNonce: true`during the agent initialization.

  If you are currently using `agent.addTransform(makeNonceTransform())` , please note that you should remove that logic, or add the `disableNonce` option to your agent when upgrading.

## [0.10.3]

### Changed

- Candid now allows optional records to be omitted. See https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/issues/524
- In `auth-client`, login `onSuccess` callback and `onError` callback now supports async pattern.
- Updates npm dependencies to resolve warnings for typedoc and node-fetch. No runtime dependencies were affected.

## [0.10.2]

### Changed

- Security enhancement - adds a rewrite for urls to subdomains of

  `\*.ic0.app/api`

  to

  `ic0.app/api`

- Improves error messages for when `HttpAgent` cannot infer `fetch` implementation

## [0.10.1]

### Changed

- Fix for the `auth-client` identity option and added JSDOC comment for the `timeToLive` option
- Sets the default Internet Identity expiration to 1 day for the `authClient`, up from 15 minutes
- No longer checks instanceof `Principal` in `@dfinity/agent`, which should allow non-identical versions of packages to interoperate, as long as they share the same API

## [0.10.0]

### Changed

- Adds changelog for `agent-js` packages
- `Buffer` and `Pipe` refactor
  - In previous versions of dfinity packages, we relied on `Buffer`, a polyfilled version of the Node.js `Buffer` utility. In a significant refactor, we have removed all cases of this, along with `Pipe` and the nonstandard `Blob` packages, in favor of `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, and `DataView`
  - Utility methods such as `blobToUint8Array` have been removed.
  - Interfaces that relied on `Buffer` and related packages have been updated to accept `ArrayBuffer`, and the type interfaces are updated to reflect this
- `Secp256k1` Support
  - Adds two new exports to `@dfinity/identity` - `Secp256k1KeyIdentity` and `Secp256k1PublicKey`
  - API mirrors the `ed25519` components, and relies on the [secp256k1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secp256k1) npm package for signing and verification.
