## Routes

The Identity Provider has a simple route scheme for its API;

- `/`. The root, which is kept empty for now, but most likely will incorporate some
  identity management functionality.
- `/authorize`. The URL used by relying parties to initiate an authorization process. This must
  remain a stable route as third parties will rely on it.

Other routes (like `/welcome`) are made available as part of the authorization process flow, but
are not documented here as they aren't officially part of the API. For now, only the routes above
are reserved names.
