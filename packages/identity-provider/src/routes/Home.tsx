 * * It doesn't matter that much for now, but without anything it can be confusing why http `GET /` just looks like an empty white page (broken?) in the web browser.
 * * Probably this should do different things based on TBD product/design requirements, e.g. if someone comes here on their own, they may be doing so in order to import/export keys or otherwise browse/manage their identities.
