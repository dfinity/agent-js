# Release new version and Publish it to NPM

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The 5-line script shared below should give you an overview of what you need to do to execute the process, however, it is **not recommended** to actually run it this way, because the script will approve and merge the PR - something you should do manually!
>
> ```
> gh workflow run "prepare-release.yml" -f "semverBump=major" && sleep 3
> RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=prepare-release.yml --status in_progress --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
> gh run watch $RUN_ID
> gh pr review $(gh pr list --json number --jq '.[0].number') --approve
> gh pr merge $(gh pr list --json number --jq '.[0].number')
> # ... and you're done with releasing and publishing!
> ```

## Release process

We utilize the [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) package to streamline our release process.

Start the process by initiating the GitHub Action Workflow `prepare-release.yml`. This can be done by:

- Navigating to the GitHub web UI and clicking "Run workflow" at https://github.com/smallstepman/agent-js/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml, or
- Running this command from your console:
  ```console
  gh workflow run "prepare-release.yml" -f "semverBump=major"
  ```
  You can set `semverBump=...` to `prepatch`, `patch`, `preminor`, `minor`, `premajor`, `major`, or any valid SemVer like `0.31.3-beta.2`, `0.32.2-abcdef`, or `0.32.0`. View your workflow progress in the console with this command:
  ```console
  gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=prepare-release.yml --status in_progress --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')`.
  ```

<details>
<summary>
  How does it work?
</summary>

The `prepare-release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs the release script via `release-it`. The process, defined in our `package.json` file, includes the following tasks:

- version bump,
- roll version in CHANGELOG.md,
- new release branch creation,
- git tag creation and push,
- suitable GitHub Release summary creation based on commit history,
- and release PR opening.

Looking at the process from perspective of git log, here is how it would look like

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': {
              'gitInv0': '#ff0000'
       } } }%%
gitGraph:
    commit id: "PR #3458"
    commit id: "PR #3451"
    commit id: "PR #3454" type: HIGHLIGHT

    branch release/0.20.0
    checkout release/0.20.0
    commit id: "Release 0.20.0" tag: "v0.20.0"

    checkout main
    merge release/0.20.0 id: "chore: release 0.20.0"

    commit id: "PR #3453"
    commit id: "PR #3460"
    commit id: "PR #3455" type: HIGHLIGHT

    branch release/0.21.0
    checkout release/0.21.0
    commit id: "Release 0.21.0" tag: "v0.21.0"

    checkout main
    merge release/0.21.0 id: "chore: release 0.21.0"

    commit id: "etc, etc"
```

The commits with red square icon, indicate the moment when release process was triggered (either by using GitHub Actionr or by running `npm run release`)

  Can I trigger the release process without using GitHub Action?
</summary>

Yes, you can manually initiate the process. To do this, you must first install the GitHub CLI binary on your system and authenticate using `gh auth login`. After login, you can trigger the process using:

```console
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm run release patch # or minor/major/etc
```

<details>
<summary>
  How can I manually perform everything (bypassing `release-it`)?
</summary>

You can execute the following commands:

```console
# Ensure you are on main branch, and there are no uncommited files
VERSION="0.20.0"
ts-node bin/version.ts $VERSION
ts-node bin/roll-changelog.ts $VERSION

git pull
git checkout release/$VERSION 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b release/$VERSION
git merge main
git push --set-upstream origin release/$VERSION

git add .
git commit -m "chore: release 0.20.0"
git tag "v0.20.0"
git push --force-with-lease

RELEASE_URL=$(gh release create v0.20.0 --generate-notes)
gh pr create --base main --title 'chore: release $VERSION' --body 'GitHub Release: $RELEASE_URL\nNPM release: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/agent/v/${version}'"
git checkout main
```

## Publishing to NPM and Document Updates

Once you've initiated a release process, the resulting pull request from the `release/...` branch to the `main` branch needs to be reviewed. Upon merging, it automatically triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which handles publishing the new version to NPM, along with updating documentation and changelog.

<details>
<summary>
  How to manually publish to NPM (without utilizing `publish.yml` workflow)?
</summary>

Perform the following steps to manually publish a package to NPM:

1. Create a branch and execute these commands:
   - `git clean -dfx`. This removes all non-tracked files and directories.
   - `npm install`. This ensures everything is installed and up-to-date locally.
   - `npm run build --workspaces`. This builds all applications and packages.
   - `npm run version [patch|major|minor|version]`. This updates the version in each package.
   - Manually update the version in the root package.json file.
   - `npm install`. This updates the packages' versions in the package-lock.json file.
2. Initiate a new release branch using `git checkout -b release/v<#.#.#>`.
3. Stage your changes with `git add .`.
4. Create a commit including your changes using `git commit -m 'chore: release v<#.#.#>'`.
5. Open a pull request from your fork of the repository.

Once the changes are merged, you can publish to NPM by running:

- `npm run build --workspaces`. Re-building for safety.
- `npm publish --workspaces`. To publish packages to NPM.
  - To do this, you will need publishing authorization under our NPM organization. Contact IT if you require access.
  - You can include the `--dry-run` flag to verify the versions and packages before actual publishing.

After publishing to NPM, go to https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/releases/new, select "Draft a new release", enter the new tag version (in `v#.#.#` format), and click "Publish release".

  How to manually publish a new version of the documents (without utilizing `publish.yml` workflow)?
</summary>

1. Start with a fresh clone (or execute `git clean -dfx .`)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Execute `npm run make:docs`
4. Deploy the docs using `dfx deploy --network ic`. Note: You may need to request for permissions as a controller for the wallet that owns the docs.

# Deprecation

To deprecate a package, follow these steps

- Remove all contents except the package.json, license, and readme
- Add a note to the README saying `**Warning** this package is deprecated`
- Remove unnecessary content, dependencies, and metadata from the package.json
- add a `"deprecation"` tag to the package.json with instructions you want users to follow in migrating
- remove the package as a workspace from the root `package.json`
- the next time that agent-js releases, manually publish a new version of newly deprecated packages by incrementing the patch version and running `npm publish`

So far, the following packages were deprecated:

- @dfinity/ledger-identityhq (#665)
- @dfinity/authentication (#665 & #661)
